Introduction
Now that weâ€™ve got our orchestrator of choice set up in our development environment thanks to Docker Desktop, we can begin to develop containerized applications. In general, the development workflow looks like this:
Create and test individual containers for each component of your application by first creating Docker images.
Assemble your containers and supporting infrastructure into a complete application, expressed either as a Docker stack file or in Kubernetes YAML.
Test, share and deploy your complete containerized application.
